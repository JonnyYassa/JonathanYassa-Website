        <div class="subheading mb-5">Digital ProductionðŸŽ¥</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My brother, Samer, started film production at the University of Southern California by the time I entered high school. He invited me to a lecture hosted by Alfred Hitchcock's granddaughter, and her passion amazed me. I was fascinated with the films and techniques Samer learned in school. He strongly influenced me to pursue my dream of storytelling. Throughout high school I decided to practice editing on Adobe After Effects and started shooting short films, I fell in love with the art. My favorite project in high school was one I worked on with my close friend, Josh. We compiled videos of famous hip hop artist, Travis Scott. We then edited our school staff names within the compilation to resemble Scott's Astroworld theme. We then submitted it to the student government advisor to play in a rally for students.<br><br>

        Towards the end of high school I decided I wanted to pursue the same route he took. I committed to University of California, Riverside with the hope that my love for film would grow. My hope became a reality as I started writing screenplays and coming up with creative solutions to better the project I was working on. An example of this is the short film I shot at my part-time job, Urban Outfitters. My boss wanted a funny short film to train the new seasonal employees, so he asked me to work on it. I created a satire about security tags and loss prevention within the store. A small project that I am extremely proud of since it resulted in good feedback on Instagram. After my boss saw the video he was impressed and asked me if he can send it to some Urban Outfitters executives to see if they will use it for general training throughout their stores. The feeling I recieved from his appreciation meant the world to me and reminded me my immense love for the art.<br><br>

        My hopes for the future is to become a sucessful screenwriter and start a studio with my brother, Samer. I hope to model my screenplays after the writers I look up to, Wes Anderson and Jordan peele. I want to sucessfully mix drama and comedy so that my audience can be on the edge of their seats while still enjoying a good laugh. In order to do that, I need to become more familiar with the art and learn from experienced professionals. One of my strengths is viewing failure as a lesson. The failures I have experienced have made me a better writer, editor, and general worker. New oppurtunites and meeting new people excite me. I am prepared and enthusiatic to work along professionals in the field. I am a hardworker and prepared to practice filmmaking with those who can better me in the art I love.
